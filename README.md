PMs Dashboard

This repository was created as part of a question:
What do Project Managers actually care about, and what should they be able to see?

The idea behind this project is to explore and visualize the key metrics that matter to PMs when they track a software project. The dashboard aims to help answer questions such as:

✔️ What information matters to Project Managers?

How many contributors are working on the project?

What branches exist and how active they are.

Recent commits and development activity.

Open pull requests and review progress.

Overall project health through GitHub API data.

✔️ What does this project provide?

A simple Python-based dashboard that connects to the GitHub API and displays essential project statistics that help PMs understand:

Team activity

Code progress

Collaboration level

Feature status

✔️ Why this repository?

It started as an experiment and a curiosity:
If we want to build a tool useful for PMs, what data should we show, and how should it look?

This repository contains the first steps toward answering that question.
